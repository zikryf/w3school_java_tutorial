// Note: Java is case-sensitive: "MyClass" and "myclass" has different meaning.
// The name of the java file must match the class name.

// every line of code that runs in Java must be inside a class
// a class name always start with an uppercase letter
// the class in this example is: Main
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
        System.out.println("Me learning Java right now.");
        
        System.out.print("Now, what can I do with Java? ");
        System.out.print("<-No new line-> Whoa what is it like this lol.");
    }
}
