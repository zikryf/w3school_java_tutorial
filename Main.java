// Note: Java is case-sensitive: "MyClass" and "myclass" has different meaning.
// The name of the java file must match the class name.

// every line of code that runs in Java must be inside a class
// a class name always start with an uppercase letter
// the class in this example is: Main
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}
